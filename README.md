# Hangman game - Console app.

This console application is a realization of the classic Hangman game. The game allows the user to guess a word randomly. After each letter is entered, information about the number of errors, and the current state of the gallows and open letters is displayed. At the end of the game, the result is displayed (win or lose), after which the user is offered to start a new game or exit the application
